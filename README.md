## Research
### Library Placement and Inequality
Used 2020 US census data to see if there is a correlation between neighborhood racial demographics and library placement in Minneapolis, MN. <br/>
Data work was done in R and ArcGIS -> you can read about it [here](https://github.com/cassandrahamilton/library-inequality)
### Madrid Digital Humanities Project
I'm currently working with the Spanish department to investigate the connotations of different monikers for the city of Madrid. We are creating a corpus from data scraped off Twiter and other online forums.
### DataCom 2022- Effect of Exercise on Mental Health
Used R to clean and analyze CDC BRFSS survey data.
Specifically looked at a cohort of people with a college degree and without children to limit additional factors.
