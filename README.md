## Research
### DataCom 2022- Effect of Exercise on Mental Health
Used R to clean and analyze CDC BRFSS survey data.
Specifically looked at a cohort of people with a college degree and without children to limit additional factors.
### Madrid Digital Humanities Project
I'm currently working with the Spanish department to investigate the connotations of different monikers for the city of Madrid. We are creating a corpus from data scraped off Twiter and other online forums.
### The Effect of Distance From a Public Library on Inequality
Coming soon!
